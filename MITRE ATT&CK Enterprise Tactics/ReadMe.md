### Introduction
This project is a work in progress, and should be updated as time goes on.  For now the basic formatting will be as follows

#### ToolName (SentinelOne | Google Chronicle/SecOps | Crowd Strike)
```
Query syntax here (tool dependant).  If multiple tools are present each will have its own header and subsequent query.
```

#### MITRE ATT&CK Techniques associated with query

## More recent queries will include a Hypothesis and Intent section as well.  Note that this will not be available on all.  As time permits, perhaps older queries will be updated, however all current and future ones will contain this information.
